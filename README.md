## Publication Bias Tests for Meta-Analysis of Diagnostic Accuracy Test

Generalized Egger tests for detecting publication bias in meta-analysis for diagnostic accuracy test are implementable. These publication bias tests are generally more powerful compared with the conventional univariate publication bias tests and can incorporate correlation information between the outcome variables.
